\section{Static Magnetic Field}

Sources of static magnetic fields are DC currents.

\subsection{What is the source of the magnetic field?}

Magnet. This is the first source of the magnetic field that people have discovered in Greece long time ago. \footnote{to be exact Â…} Danish scientist Oersted discovered later that the current passing through wire will deflect a compass needle. Later French scientists Biot and Savart quantified this statement:

\begin{eqnarray}
B = \mu_0 \frac{I}{2 \pi r}
\end{eqnarray}

Where B is magnetic flux density, $\mu_0$ is magnetic permeability, I is the electric current, and r is the distance to the point where the magnetic field is measured.

HERE PICTURE WITH A WIRE AND THE magnetic field.

\subsection{Inductance}
Types, internal external.  Ways to find inductance through energy and directly. What is inductance, how does it affect circuits.

{\large EXAMPLE} Two wire line
{\large EXAMPLE} Coax
{\large EXAMPLE} Internal inductance of wire, block etc.

\subsection{Mutual Inductance}
