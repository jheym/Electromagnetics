\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Explain why is the impedance matching needed
\item How real power changes from the input to the output of a lossless transmission line
\item Explain how maximum available power from the generator affects power on transmission line.
\item Explain how minimum reflection from the generator affects power on a transmission line.
\item Explain how minimum reflection from the load affects power on a transmission line.
\item Design a simple impedance matching network for any load impedance and discuss pros and cons of various designs.
\item Design a mixed impedance matching network for any load impedance and discuss pros and cons of various designs.
\item Design a transmission-line impedance matching network for any load impedance and discuss pros and cons of various designs.
\item Design a lumped element impedance matching network for any load impedance and discuss pros and cons of various designs.

\end{itemize}
