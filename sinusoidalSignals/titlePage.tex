\begin{sectionOutcomes}
After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe basic properties of sinusoidal functions.
\item Compare and contrast phase and time-delay.
\item Recognize leading and lagging signals. 
\item Explain why is a signal leading or lagging.
\item Remember eLi the iCe man.
\item Explain how is a sinusoidal signal different at the beginning and end of a transmission line.
\item Derive equation of a wave on a transmission line by considering finite propagation speed of electric signals.
\item Determine whether the transmission-line theory should be used based on line length and signal frequency.
\end{itemize}
