\section{Electric Field due to a Charge Distribution}


This is an optional section.

\subsection{Derive Analytical Solution for the Electric field Due to a Loop of Charge }



We will first find the electric field due to a loop of charge. The loop of charge is charged with the line charge density $\rho_l$ and is in the X-Y plane, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:loopSinglePt}.  To solve this problem, we first divide the loop into small pieces. The small (blue) arc obtained in this way can be considered a point charge. The electric field due to a point charge is shown in Figure \ref{fig:loopSinglePt}(the blue arrow).  The position of the point charge is defined by a position vector $\vec{r_2}$. The position of point P is defined with the position vector  $\vec{r_1}$. The vector  $\vec{dE}$ is defined in  Equation  \ref{genfieldloop}.


\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{dE}=\frac{dQ}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {r}^2} \hat{r} \label{genfieldloop}
\end{eqnarray}


The total electric field at a point P is then equal to the sum of all the fields due to the point charges, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:loopAllPts}. The equation for the total field is given in Equation \ref{eqtotfieldring}. 

\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{E}=\int\limits_{all \,\, point \,\, charges} \vec{dE} \label{eqtotfieldring}
\end{eqnarray}

\end{figure}

The problem now  is to represent all the variables in the Equation \ref{genfieldloop}  ( $dQ$, $dl$, $\hat{r}$ and $r$) using  appropriate coordinate system and given charge distribution.
The  total charge on the segment $dl$ is equal to $dQ=\rho_l dl$. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:loopAllPts}, $dl$ is an arc length in the direction of theta, $dl=a\, d\theta$, where $ a$ is the radius of the loop. The vector $\vec{r_2}$ is the position vector of the arc length $dl$, and the vector $\vec{r_1}$  is the position vector of the point be of the electric field calculation. Point P is an arbitrary point in the Cartesian coordinate system, P(x,y,z), therefore its vector is shown in Equation \ref{eq1loop}.  The vector $\vec{r}$ is the distance vector between the point charge (the source) and the point at which we are calculating the electric field. 



\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{r_1}=x \vec{a_x} + y \vec{a_y} +z\vec{a_z} \label{eq1loop}
\end{eqnarray}

The vector $\vec{r_2}$ can be written in Polar Coordinates as in Equation \ref{pcvec},where $a$ is the radius of the loop. The equation \ref{pcvec} can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinate system as shown in Equation \ref{csloopvec}.

\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{r_2}=a \, \vec{a_r} \label{pcvec} \\
\vec{a_r}= \,cos{\theta} \, \vec{a_x}+ sin{\theta} \, \vec{a_y} \\
\vec{r_2}=a \, cos{\theta}\,  \vec{a_x}+ a \, sin{\theta} \, \vec{a_y} \label{csloopvec}
\end{eqnarray}

The two vectors mark the beginning and the end of the distance vector $\vec{r}$. The vector  $\vec{r}$ is the sum of vectors $-\vec{r_2}$ and $\vec{r_1}$. 



\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{r}=\vec{r_1} + (-\vec{r_2})
\end{eqnarray}

Or:

\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{r}= (x -  a \,cos{\theta}) \vec{a_x} +(y - a \,sin{\theta}) \vec{a_y} +z \vec{a_z}
\end{eqnarray}

Vector $\vec{r}$ has the magnitude of:


\begin{eqnarray}
|\vec{r}|= \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta})^2 +z ^2}\label{vecrloop1}
\end{eqnarray}

Unit vector in the direction of vector $\vec{r}$ is:


\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{r}= \frac{\vec{r}}{|\vec{r}|} \\
\hat{r}=\frac{\vec{r}}{\sqrt{(x - a \, cos{\theta})^2 +(y - a  \, sin{\theta})^2 +z^2}}\label{vecrloop2}
\end{eqnarray}


Replacing other variables in the Equations \ref{eq1loop}-\ref{vecrloop2} to the Equation \ref{genfieldloop}, we get the    Equation \ref{totalfieldloop} for the electric field $\vec{dE}$ at a point P.

\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{dE}= \frac{\rho_l \, a \, d\theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta})^2 +z ^2}  }^3} \cdots  \nonumber \\ \cdots (x -  a \,cos{\theta}) \vec{a_x} +(y - a \,sin{\theta}) \vec{a_y} +z \vec{a_z} \label{totalfieldloop}
\end{eqnarray}

Components of the electric field are given in Equations \ref{totalfieldloop1}-\ref{totalfieldloop3}.


\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{dE_x}= \frac{\rho_l \, a \, d\theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta})^2 +z ^2}  }^3}   (x -  a \,cos{\theta}) \vec{a_x}  \label{totalfieldloop1} \\
\vec{dE_y}= \frac{\rho_l \, a \, d\theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta})^2 +z ^2}  }^3}   (y - a \,sin{\theta}) \vec{a_y}  \label{totalfieldloop2} \\
\vec{dE_z}= \frac{\rho_l \, a \, d\theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta})^2 +z ^2}  }^3}   z \vec{a_z} \label{totalfieldloop3}
\end{eqnarray}

Each component of the field can be integrated separately, as shown in Equations \ref{totalfieldloop4}-\ref{totalfieldloop6}.



\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{E_x}= \int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\rho_l \,a \,        (x -  a \,cos{\theta})         d\theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta})^2 +z ^2}  }^3}    \vec{a_x}  \label{totalfieldloop4} \\
\vec{E_y}=  \int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\rho_l \, a \,   (y - a \,sin{\theta})   d\theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta})^2 +z ^2}  }^3}  \vec{a_y}  \label{totalfieldloop5} \\
\vec{E_z}=  \int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\rho_l \, a \,  z   d\theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta})^2 +z ^2}  }^3}  \vec{a_z} \label{totalfieldloop6}
\end{eqnarray}

The integrals in Equations \ref{totalfieldloop4}-\ref{totalfieldloop6}  can be integrated analytically in some special cases only. In general, this is in an elliptical integral and cannot be solved analytically. However, this integral can be sold numerically.


\subsection{Derive Numerical solution to the Electric Field due to a Loop of Charge}

The integrals in equations \ref{totalfieldloop4}-\ref{totalfieldloop6} can be represented as infinite sums using  simple numerical integration as shown in Equations \ref{totalfieldloop4n}-\ref{totalfieldloop6n}.  Here we see that the continuous function of $\theta$ was replaced with the discrete values of  $\theta$.




\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{E_x}= \sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{\rho_l \,a \,        (x -  a \,cos{\theta_i})         \Delta \theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta_i})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta_i})^2 +z ^2}  }^3}    \vec{a_x}  \label{totalfieldloop4n} \\
\vec{E_y}=  \sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{\rho_l \, a \,   (y - a \,sin{\theta_i})  \Delta  \theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta_i})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta_i})^2 +z ^2}  }^3}  \vec{a_y}  \label{totalfieldloop5n} \\
\vec{E_z}=  \sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{\rho_l \, a \,  z   \Delta \theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta_i})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta_i})^2 +z ^2}  }^3}  \vec{a_z} \label{totalfieldloop6n}
\end{eqnarray}

$\Delta\theta$ represents the length of the interval that the line is divided into, $\theta_i$ represents the value of angle at a certain point, and $i$ designates different points on the loop. It should be noted here that the error due to the trapezoidal rule can be improved by using more advanced numerical integration techniques.

\subsection{Matlab Code to Find the Electric Field due to a Loop of Charge }
 

Equations \ref{totalfieldloop4n}-\ref{totalfieldloop6n} can be implemented in Matlab as shown below. Cut-and-paste the program below in Matlab editor.

\section{Potential}

\subsection{Derive Analytical Solution for the Potential  Due to a Loop of Charge }

Derive the potential due to a ring of charge, charged with a line charge density $\rho_l$. 


Potential due to a point charge is given in Equation \ref{genpotloop}. We will first find the potential due to a loop of charge. Assume that the loop of charge is charged with the line charge density $\rho_l$. The loop of charge is in the X-Y plane, as shown in Figure \ref{loopanyptf}.  First, we will divide the loop into small pieces. We will assume that the small arc obtained in this way can be considered a point charge. The potential due to a point charge at a point P is labeled in Figure \ref{loopanyptf} as $dV$.  The position of the point charge is defined by a position vector $\vec{r_2}$. The position of point P is defined with the position vector  $\vec{r_1}$. The electric scalar potential $dV$ is defined in  Equation  \ref{genpotloop}.


\begin{eqnarray}
dV=\frac{dQ}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {r}}  \label{genpotloop}
\end{eqnarray}


\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{center}
\caption{Loop of wire uniformly charged with line charge density $\rho_l$. Electric field is shown due to a very small section (arc length) of the loop $dl$.}
\label{loopanyptf}
\end{figure}

The total potential at a point P is then equal to the sum of all the potentials due to the point charges, as shown in Figure \ref{loopanypt1}. The equation for the total potential is given in \ref{eqtotfieldringpot}. 

\begin{eqnarray}
V=\int\limits_{all \,\, point \,\, charges} dV \label{eqtotfieldringpot}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Loop of wire uniformly charged with line charge density $\rho_l$. Electric field is shown due to several very small sections (arc length) of the loop $dl$.
Each section is modeled by a point charge $dQ$.}
\label{loopanypt1}
\end{figure}



The problem now  is to represent all the variables in the Equation \ref{genpotloop}  ( $dQ$, $dl$, $\hat{r}$ and $r$) using  appropriate coordinate system and given charge distribution.
The  total charge on the segment $dl$ is equal to $dQ=\rho_l dl$. As seen in Figure \ref{loopanyptf}, $dl$ is an arc length in the direction of theta (blue arrow next to $dl$) $dl=a\, d\theta$, where $ a$ is the radius of the loop. The vector $\vec{r_2}$ is the position vector of the arc length $dl$, and the vector $\vec{r_1}$  is the position vector of the point be of the electric field calculation. Point P is an arbitrary point in the Cartesian coordinate system, P(x,y,z), therefore its vector is shown in Equation \ref{eq1loopp}.  The vector $\vec{r}$ is the distance vector between the point charge (the source) and the point at which we are calculating the electric field. 



\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{r_1}=x \vec{a_x} + y \vec{a_y} +z\vec{a_z} \label{eq1loopp}
\end{eqnarray}

The vector $\vec{r_2}$ can be written in Polar Coordinates as in equation \ref{pcvecp},where $a$ is the radius of the loop. The Equation \ref{pcvecp} can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinate system as in Equation \ref{csloopvecp}.

\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{r_2}=a \, \vec{a_r} \label{pcvecp} \\
\vec{a_r}= \,cos{\theta} \, \vec{a_x}+ sin{\theta} \, \vec{a_y} \\
\vec{r_2}=a \, cos{\theta}\,  \vec{a_x}+ a \, sin{\theta} \, \vec{a_y} \label{csloopvecp}
\end{eqnarray}

The two vectors mark the beginning and the end of the distance vector $\vec{r}$. The vector  $\vec{r}$ is the sum of vectors $-\vec{r_2}$ and $\vec{r_1}$. 



\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{r}=\vec{r_1} + (-\vec{r_2})
\end{eqnarray}


Therefore the vector's $\vec{r}$  magnitude is shown in Equations \ref{vecrloop1p}.


\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{r}= (x -  a \,cos{\theta}) \vec{a_x} +(y - a \,sin{\theta}) \vec{a_y} +z \vec{a_z}
\end{eqnarray}

Vector $\vec{r}$ has the magnitude of:


\begin{eqnarray}
|\vec{r}|= \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta})^2 +z ^2}\label{vecrloop1p}
\end{eqnarray}

Replacing other variables in the Equations \ref{eq1loopp}-\ref{vecrloop1p} to the Equation \ref{genpotloop}, we get the    Equation \ref{totpot} for the potential $dV$ at a point P.

\begin{eqnarray}
dV= \frac{\rho_l \, a \, d\theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta})^2 +z ^2}  }}\label{totpot}
\end{eqnarray}



\begin{eqnarray}
V= \int\limits_0^{2 \pi}\frac{\rho_l \, a \, d\theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta})^2 +z ^2}  }}\label{totalfieldloopp2}
\end{eqnarray}








The integral in Equation \ref{totalfieldloopp2} can be integrated analytically in some special cases; however, this equation can be solved numerically, as shown in the next section.






\subsection{Derive Numerical solution to the Electric Field due to a Loop of Charge}



The integrals in equations \ref{totalfieldloopp2} can be represented with infinite sum using simple numerical integration (trapezoidal rule), as shown in Equations \ref{totalfieldloop6np}.  Here we see that the continuous function of $\theta$ was replaced with the discrete values of  $\theta$.




\begin{eqnarray}
V=  \sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{\rho_l \, a   \Delta \theta }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} {  \sqrt{(x - a \,cos{\theta_i})^2 +(y - a \,sin{\theta_i})^2 +z ^2}  }}  \label{totalfieldloop6np}
\end{eqnarray}

Where $\Delta\theta$ represents the length of the interval that the line is divided into, $\theta_i$ represents the value of angle at a certain point, and $i$ designates different points on the loop. It should be noted here that the error due to the trapezoidal rule can be improved by using more advanced numerical integration techniques.

\section{Visualizing Scalar Fields in Matlab}

To visualize scalar fields in Matlab, we can use the following functions: slice, contourslice, patch, isonormals, camlight, and lightning. Please note that a more detailed explanation about these functions shown here can be found in Matlab's help.

\subsection{slice}
 
Slice is a command that shows the magnitude of a scalar field on a plane that slices the volume where the potential field is visualized. The format of this command is as shown below.

\begin{verbatim}
slice(x,y,z,v,xslice,yslice,zslice)
\end{verbatim}

Where X, Y, and Z are coordinates of points where the scaler function is calculated, V is v the scalar function at those points, and the last three vectors xslice, yslice, and zslice  are showing where will the volume will be sliced.

An example of slice command is given below. In the example below, there is an additional command colormap that colors the volume with a specific palette. To see more about different color maps, see Matlab's help. xslice has three points at which the x-axis will be slice. They are -1.2, .8, 2. This means that the volume will be slice with a plane that is perpendicular to the x-axis, and it crosses the x-axis at points -1.2, .8, and 2. 
 
\begin{verbatim}
clc
clear all
[x,y,z] = meshgrid(-2:.2:2,-2:.25:2,-2:.16:2);
v = x.*exp(-x.^2-y.^2-z.^2);
xslice = [-1.2,.8,2]; yslice = 1; zslice = [-2,0];
slice(x,y,z,v,xslice,yslice,zslice)
colormap hsv
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{contourslice}

 Contourslice command will display equipotential lines on a plane being the volume where the potential field is visualized. An example of a contourslice function is shown below.

\begin{verbatim}
[x,y,z] = meshgrid(-2:.2:2,-2:.25:2,-2:.16:2);
v = x.*exp(-x.^2-y.^2-z.^2); % Create volume data
[xi,yi,zi] = sphere; % Plane to contour
contourslice(x,y,z,v,xi,yi,zi)
view(3)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{patch}

Patch command creates a patch of color.


\subsection{isonormals}

Command isonormals create equipotential surfaces. 
\subsection{camlight}

\begin{verbatim}
camlight('headlight') creates a light at the camera position.

camlight('right') creates a light
right and up from camera.

camlight('left') creates a light
left and up from camera.camlight with no arguments is the
same as camlight('right').

camlight(az,el) creates a light
at the specified azimuth (az) and elevation (el)
with respect to the camera position.

The camera target is the center of rotation, 
and az and el are in degrees.

\end{verbatim}



\subsection{lighting}


\begin{verbatim}
Lighting flat selects flat lighting.

Lighting gouraud selects gouraud lighting.

Lighting phong selects phong lighting.

lighting none turns off lighting.
\end{verbatim}
