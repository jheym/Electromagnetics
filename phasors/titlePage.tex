\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Remember the cosine-referenced phasor transformation.
\item Apply phasor transformation to transform time-domain circuit equations for resistor, capacitor and inductor to frequency domain.
\item Apply phasor transformation to transform time-domain sinusoidal signals to frequency-domain signals (phasors) and vice versa, transform phasors to time-domain.
\item Solve a simple electric circucuit using phasors.
\item Sketch vector phasor diagram to visualize voltage and current addition.
\item Visualize and sketch sinusoidal voltages and currents  in time-domain for simple RC, RL circuits.
\item Recognize a simple circuit from the visualized time-domain  or phasor voltages and currents.
\end{itemize}
